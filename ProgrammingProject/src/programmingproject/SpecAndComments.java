/*
• read in the csv file and store the data (in
setup), as for last week.
• create a (simple) query result and set this
to be the current query (in setup)
• write a method which will draw this query
result as a chart (e.g., bar chart).
• draw the results of this query as a bar
chart (in draw), using the method you have
defined.

o Not all the data will be shown on the screen at one time, and so a set of queries must be defined in your
code. At a minimum, the following queries should be implemented:
▪ View the data for a particular medallion.
▪ Data for a particular vendor.
▪ Summary data for a rate_code.
▪ Identify “hot”areas of the city. Hot areas are identified by the affluence of pick-ups and drop-offs
at different times of the day (e.g., many drop-offs in the business area).
▪ Statistic (longest, shortest, average trip with respect to time and distance) information for all trips
of the selected data in the aforementioned categories.

Exceptional compression of data
Data input handles null fields by skipping entry
